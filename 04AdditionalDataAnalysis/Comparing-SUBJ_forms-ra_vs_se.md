# Comparing the two SUBJ forms: -ra vs. -se

Both the _-ra_ and _-sa_ SUBJ forms were used across the sentences which had a SUBJ embedded clause, i.e. the SUBJ condition in [the experimental items](/02ExpItems/ES_NR_ExpItems.csv), 
such that half of the SUBJ sentences had the _-ra_ SUBJ form and the other half had the _-se_ SUBJ form. 

Here follows a brief comparison of the two SUBJ forms for their overall acceptability and their ability to be interpreted with the Neg-raising reading.

### Acceptability 

#### Mean acceptability by SUBJ form

| SUBJ form | mean acceptability |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
| _-se_     | 5.9                |
| _-ra_     | 6.0                |

#### Mean acceptability by SUBJ form in each sentence type

| sentence type | SUBJ form | mean acceptability |
| :-----------: | :-------: | :----------------: |
| NR+NPI        | _-se_     | 5.2                |
| NR+NPI        | _-ra_     | 5.8                |
| NR            | _-se_     | 6.4                |
| NR            | _-ra_     | 6.1                |
| Non-NR        | _-se_     | 6.0                |
| Non-NR        | _-ra_     | 6.1                |

**Conclusion**: there does not appear to have been a large difference in acceptability between the two SUBJ forms. 


### NR inferencing

#### Mean frequency of NR interpretability by SUBJ form

| SUBJ form | mean freq. NR interpretability [95%CI] |
| :-------: | :------------------------------------: |
| _-ra_     | 0.62 [0.57, 0.67]                      |
| _-se_     | 0.63 [0.58, 0.68]                      |

#### Mean frequency of NR interpretability by strict NPI by sentence type

| sentence type | SUBJ form | mean freq. NR interpretability [95%CI] |
| :-----------: | :-------: | :------------------------------------: |
| Non-NR        | _-ra_     | 0.12 [0.06, 0.17]                      |
| Non-NR        | _-se_     | 0.18 [0.11, 0.24]                      |
| NR            | _-ra_     | 0.92 [0.87, 0.97]                      |
| NR            | _-se_     | 0.88 [0.83, 0.93]                      |
| NR+NPI        | _-ra_     | 0.84 [0.78, 0.91]                      |
| NR+NPI        | _-se_     | 0.87 [0.81, 0.94]                      |
