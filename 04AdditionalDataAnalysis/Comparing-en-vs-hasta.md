# Comparing the two strict NPIs: _en_ N vs. _hasta_

The two different strict NPIs _en_ N 'in Ns' and _hasta_ 'until' were used across [the experimental items](/02ExpItems/ES_NR_ExpItems.csv)
for the NR+NPI sentence type condition, i.e. half of the NR+NPI items contained _en_ N and the other half contained _hasta_.
The use of two different NPIs was to increase variety, both for the participant as well as in the representation of the data. 

Here follows a brief comparison of the two NPIs in terms of their overall acceptability and ability to be interpreted with the Neg-raising reading.

### Acceptability 

#### Mean acceptability by strict NPI

| strict NPI | mean acceptability |
| :--------: | :----------------: |
| _en_ N     | 4.6                |
| _hasta_    | 4.9                |

#### Mean acceptability by strict NPI by mood

| mood | strict NPI | mean acceptability |
| :--: | :--------: | :----------------: |
| SUBJ | _en_ N     | 5.3                |
| SUBJ | _hasta_    | 5.7                |
| IND  | _en_ N     | 3.8                |
| IND  | _hasta_    | 4.1                |

**Conclusion**: there does not appear to have been a large difference in acceptability between the two NPIs. 


### NR inferencing

#### Mean frequency of NR interpretability by strict NPI

| strict NPI | mean freq. NR interpretability |
| :--------: | :----------------------------: |
| _en_ N     | 0.85                           |
| _hasta_    | 0.82                           |


#### Mean frequency of NR interpretability by strict NPI by mood

| mood | strict NPI | mean freq. NR interpretability |
| :--: | :--------: | :----------------------------: |
| SUBJ | _en_ N     | 0.84                           |
| SUBJ | _hasta_    | 0.87                           |
| IND  | _en_ N     | 0.87                           |
| IND  | _hasta_    | 0.74                           |
