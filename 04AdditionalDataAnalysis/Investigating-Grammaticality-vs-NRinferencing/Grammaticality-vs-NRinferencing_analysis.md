# Grammaticality vs NR Inferencing

Our results indicated that sentences in the NR+NPI condition were *less* often interpretable with the NR reading than plain NR sentences without NPIs. 
This result is rather interesting and counterintuitive, as it is expected that the NPI is licensed *because of* the NR reading. 

One idea for why this result occured is that sentences with NPIs were overall less acceptable/grammatical than those without NPIs, and perhaps this drop in acceptability resulted in a lower ability to get the NR interpretation. 

Note that in the experiment, only sentences which were rated as 4-7 in acceptability were asked for their ability to convey the NR interpretation. Sentences which were rated as 1-3 in acceptability were deemed "too unacceptable" to have a clear enough interpretation to ask about its NR reading. 

**Q**: Does the frequency of NR interpretation correlate with the level of acceptability/grammaticality? Specifically, are sentences which receive a lower grammaticality value also less often interpretable with the NR interpretation?
