# Investigating the ungrammaticality of the fillers

There were 12 total filler items in the experiment along with the 48 experimental items. 
The fillers were crafted to be ungrammatical in order to increase representation of the lower end of the grammaticality scale in Q1.
Additionally, the fillers were made using the same six non-NRPs used in the experimental items to increase representation of those predicates as compared to the NRPs.

There were **two types of filler items**:
1. a non-negated non-NRP with an indicative embedded clause containing a strict NPI (**Pos+IND+NPI**)    

    e.g. _Enrique aseguraba [que el festival iba a comenzar hasta las siete]._    
          Enrique assured [that the festival was.IND going to begin until seven]

    These items are expected to be ungrammatical/unacceptable due to the strict NPI in the embedded clause and lack of negation in the sentence.
          
2. a non-negated non-NRP with a subjunctive embedded clause (**Pos+SUBJ**)      
  
    e.g. _Teresa sab√≠a [que fuese a llover ese mes]._      
    Teresa knew [that it was.SUBJ going to rain this month]

    These items are expected to be ungrammatical due to the SUBJ embedded clause as the six non-NRPs cannot take SUBJ in affirmative (i.e. non-negated) clauses.


There were six filler items of each type, one per each of the six non-NRPs, which were shown to each participant. 
As these were merely filler items, they were not counterbalanced. 

However, we nevertheless present their average grammaticality score as a useful comparison for the grammaticality of the experimental items.
Note that the **Pos+IND+NPI** fillers represent sentences which are **unacceptable** due to a lack of ability to license the strict NPI.
Meanwhile, the **Pos+SUBJ** fillers represent sentences which are **ungrammatical** due to the non-NRPs' inability to select for a SUBJ embedded clause (in affirmative sentences).

#### Mean acceptability of the fillers

The mean acceptability score for the two filler item types: 
| Filler item type | mean acceptability |
| :--------------: | :----------------: |
| Pos+IND+NPI      | 2.9 |
| Pos+SUBJ         | 2.7 |

The fillers were thus rated as rather unacceptable, as expected. The Pos+IND+NPI fillers were slightly more acceptable than the Pos+SUBJ fillers.

**Conclusion**: the experimental items in the NR+NPI with indicative construction were rated as somewhat more acceptable than both of the filler item types, but had overlap with the ungrammatical fillers.

#### Mean acceptability of the fillers per predicate

The mean acceptability score for the two filler item types per predicate: 
| Filler item type | mean acceptability  |
| :--------------: | :-----------------: |
| **Pos+IND+NPI**                  |     |
| *saber* 'know'                   | 2.5 |
| *estar seguro* 'be sure'         | 2.9 |
| *ser consciente* 'be aware'      | 2.5 |
| *resultar evidente* 'be evident' | 4.6 |
| *asegurar* 'assure'              | 2.3 |
| *recordar* 'remember'            | 2.3 |
| **Pos+SUBJ**                     |     |
| *saber* 'know'                   | 1.9 |
| *estar seguro* 'be sure'         | 3.0 |
| *ser consciente* 'be aware'      | 3.4 |
| *resultar evidente* 'be evident' | 2.8 |
| *asegurar* 'assure'              | 2.8 |
| *recordar* 'remember'            | 2.5 |
